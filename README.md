# web2dao

web2dao is buying web2 domain names and turning them into NFTs. The holders of the NFTs actually control the domains through the DAO and a bonded off-chain custodian.

We accomplish this with a Gnosis Safe, where DAO members pool funds to acquire and tokenize domains, a bond posted on-chain by the web2 domain custodian, and an Optimistic Governor contract connected to UMA's oracle, which enforces the rules around withdrawals, tokenization, and slashing the custodian's bond.

The custodian can lose part or all of their bond if they disobey the rules, for example, if they fail to update DNS settings as requested by the holder of a particular domain's NFT. This gives on-chain guarantees that the real-world property of the DAO and NFT holders is meaningfully under their control.

We intend to apply what we learn from web2dao to DAO ownership of more complex real-world assets like land and real estate.
